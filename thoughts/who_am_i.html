<p>
	this is who i was and this is who i am.

<h3> who i was </h3>
<p>
	growing up, i never had a role model, somebody that inspires me in real life, someone i admire. i don't have a father that
	guides me on what is right or what is wrong, i had to figure it out myself. luckily, the internet had already existed.
	during my childhood, probably when i was 13 years old or below, i did not have that intellectual curiosity in me, all i cared
	about was impressing my friends and playing video games. it wasn't until i was around 15 years old that i had an existential
	crisis (i am privileged to have this). during that time period, i had the darkest thoughts of my entire life. i asked heavy
	questions that haunted me: what is the meaning of life? why are we here? what is my purpose? from then on, i started to become
	curious about philosophy, i regarded it as the antidote to the pain i was feeling. the human condition.
</p>

<p>
	as a young kid, who was sheltered, who was not able to excel academically, socially, or even physically 
	the only way for me to get out of my own head and stay sane was by satiating my curiosity for what is out there in life.
</p>

<p>
	life felt stagnant, i felt that i was not living, i wasn't engaging properly with life, i rarely put myself out there, i was 
	just playing video games (not that i dislike video games) and being foolish with friends. i regret that i didn't learn or didn't
	take an interest in every subject in school, i regret not fully engaging with the community within school, i was distracted by
	this need to impress other people, this need to be liked by girls, this need to be validated. i used my age as an excuse that 
	it was fine to live this way (until i found people i admire and how they carried themselves when they were young).
	so i tried, i tried changing my external world to change my internal state, which made me even more miserable 
	because no matter what you change in the external world, it does not change your internal state and i did not
	know that when i was young.
</p>

 <p>
	i watched countless of videos about the questions i had, read articles, read phrases in books, and it accumulated until i
	felt that i had been overloaded with information and that i felt "smart" just because i know "a lot," but that is not the case.
	i was the same guy with just more jumbled ideas and thoughts in his head. no way in hell was i better after watching that
	youtube video or that book or even that article, because i never took action. i lacked the courage to initiate action.
 </p>

 <p>
	there is a saying that our thoughts are wiser than our actions, and i believe that. a lot of people say the deepest and wisest
	thoughts and yet still remain the same in terms of their actions, the reason is because actions are harder than words. it
	is very difficult to integrate both your words and your actions. to have no contradictions between them whatsoever, to have them
	fully aligned with each other, that is extremely rare and <a href="theodore_roosevelt.html">theodore roosevelt</a> is one of those rare people
	(he didn't just talk about it, he was about it).
